# Time Splitting Game

* Two teams, one is playing normally, then the other team plays in reverse
* Use logs to re-create the first run through of the battle
* Second game uses logs to then fight the first runthrough of the battle
* Unsure on how to trigger the loop, possibly with AI
* Continuous loop of games that use the previous games loop or run through, fighting against the past
* Traps/bombs can be planted by the first team, for the second team to fail on
* Would need an ai mechanism take over when the NPC lives longer than they're supposed to
	* If health not 0 before death point, AI would need to take over and finish objective
* Possibly link into Skyscraper game
* Work as a team to clear the room, but different objective depending on what team they're on
*
