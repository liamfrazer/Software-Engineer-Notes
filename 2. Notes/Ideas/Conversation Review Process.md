# Conversation Review Process

* Idea is focused around building an application that can control the conversation review process
* Similar to a Lean or Kanban board, the start of a process can be fully tracked from start to finish
* People can be assigned to their tasks as either builders/reviewers/owners etc
* Will fully track a conversation from the start of building, whether its being reviewed, who reviewed it and then eventually connected to a release
* Potential for data to be applied to the specific tasks
* Can add a state once the conversation is released, to then monitor the outcome of the conversation via traditional stat methods
* If a conversation is not performing as expected, this could be tracked via this board and then re-pulled back into the review process
* This then controls the lifecycle of the journey, start to finish as well as any returning updates
